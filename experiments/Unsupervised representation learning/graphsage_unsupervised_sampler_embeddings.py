Stellargraph Unsupervised GraphSAGE is the implementation of GraphSAGE method outlined in the paper: [Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs.](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/) W.L. Hamilton, R. Ying, and J. Leskovec arXiv:1706.02216
[cs.SI], 2017.

This notebook is a short demo of how Stellargraph Unsupervised GraphSAGE can be used to learn embeddings of the nodes representing papers in the [CORA citation network](https://linqs-data.soe.ucsc.edu/public/lbc/cora.tgz). Furthermore, this notebook demonstrates the use of the learnt embeddings in a downstream node classification task (classifying papers by subject). Note that the node embeddings can also be used in other graph machine learning tasks, such as link prediction, community detection, etc.

## Unsupervised GraphSAGE:

A high-level explanation of the unsupervised GraphSAGE method of graph representation learning is as follows.

Objective: *Given a graph, learn embeddings of the nodes using only the graph structure and the node features, without using any known node class labels* (hence "unsupervised"; for semi-supervised learning of node embeddings, see this [demo](../node-classification/graphsage-node-classification.ipynb))

**Unsupervised GraphSAGE model:** In the Unsupervised GraphSAGE model, node embeddings are learnt by solving a simple classification task: given a large set of "positive" `(target, context)` node pairs generated from random walks performed on the graph (i.e., node pairs that co-occur within a certain context window in random walks), and an equally large set of "negative" node pairs that are randomly selected from the graph according to a certain distribution, learn a binary classifier that predicts whether arbitrary node pairs are likely to co-occur in a random walk performed on the graph. Through learning this simple binary node-pair-classification task, the model automatically learns an inductive mapping from attributes of nodes and their neighbors to node embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space, which preserves structural and feature similarities of the nodes. Unlike embeddings obtained by algorithms such as [Node2Vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec), this mapping is inductive: given a new node (with attributes) and its links to other nodes in the graph (which was unseen during model training), we can evaluate its embeddings without having to re-train the model.

In our implementation of Unsupervised GraphSAGE, the training set of node pairs is composed of an equal number of positive and negative `(target, context)` pairs from the graph. The positive `(target, context)` pairs are the node pairs co-occurring on random walks over the graph whereas the negative node pairs are sampled randomly from a global node degree distribution of the graph.

The architecture of the node pair classifier is the following. Input node pairs (with node features) are fed, together with the graph structure, into a pair of identical GraphSAGE encoders, producing a pair of node embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into a node pair classification layer, which applies a binary operator to those node embeddings (e.g., concatenating them), and passes the resulting node pair embeddings through a linear transform followed by a binary activation (e.g., sigmoid), thus predicting a binary label for the node pair.

The entire model is trained end-to-end by minimizing the loss function of choice (e.g., binary cross-entropy between predicted node pair labels and true link labels) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates of the model parameters, with minibatches of 'training' links generated on demand and fed into the model.

Node embeddings obtained from the encoder part of the trained classifier can be used in various downstream tasks. In this demo, we show how these can be used for predicting node labels.

"""## Unsupervised GraphSAGE  with on demand sampling
The Unsupervised GraphSAGE requires a training sample that can be either provided as a list of `(target, context)` node pairs or it can be provided with an `UnsupervisedSampler` instance that takes care of generating positive and negative samples of node pairs on demand. In this demo we discuss the latter technique.

### UnsupervisedSampler:
The `UnsupervisedSampler` class takes in a `Stellargraph` graph instance. The `generator` method in the `UnsupervisedSampler`  is responsible for generating equal number of positive and negative node pair samples from the graph  for training. The samples are generated by performing uniform random walks over the graph, using `UniformRandomWalk` object. Positive `(target, context)` node pairs are extracted from the walks, and for each
positive pair a corresponding negative pair `(target, node)` is generated by randomly sampling `node` from the degree distribution of the graph. Once the `batch_size` number of samples is accumulated, the generator yields a list of positive and negative node pairs along with their respective 1/0 labels.  

In the current implementation, we use uniform random walks to explore the graph structure. The length and number of walks, as well as the root nodes for starting the walks can be user-specified. The default list for root nodes is all nodes of the graph, default `number_of_walks` is 1 (at least one walk per root node), and the default `length` of walks is 2 (need at least one node beyond the root node on the walk as a potential positive context).

**1. Specify the other optional parameter values: root nodes, the number of walks to take per node, the length of each walk, and random seed.**

    G, nodes=nodes, length=length, number_of_walks=number_of_walks
)

"""The graph G together with the unsupervised sampler will be used to generate samples.

**3. Create a node pair generator:**

Next, create the node pair generator for sampling and streaming the training data to the model. The node pair generator essentially "maps" pairs of nodes `(target, context)` to the input of GraphSAGE: it either takes minibatches of node pairs, or an `UnsupervisedSampler` instance which generates the minibatches of node pairs on demand. The generator samples 2-hop subgraphs with `(target, context)` head nodes extracted from those pairs, and feeds them, together with the corresponding binary labels indicating which pair represent positive or negative sample, to the input layer of the node pair classifier with GraphSAGE node encoder, for SGD updates of the model parameters.

Specify:
1. The minibatch size (number of node pairs per minibatch).
2. The number of epochs for training the model.
3. The sizes of 1- and 2-hop neighbor samples for GraphSAGE:

"""### Uses for unsupervised graph representation learning
1. Unsupervised GraphSAGE learns embeddings of unlabeled graph nodes. This is highly useful as most of the real-world data is typically either unlabeled, or have noisy, unreliable, or sparse labels. In such scenarios unsupervised techniques that learn low-dimensional meaningful representation of nodes in a graph by leveraging the graph structure and features of the nodes is useful.
2. Moreover, GraphSAGE is an inductive technique that allows us to obtain embeddings of unseen nodes, without the need to re-train the embedding model. That is, instead of training individual embeddings for each node (as in algorithms such as `node2vec` that learn a look-up table of node embeddings), GraphSAGE learns a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating attributes from each node's local neighborhood, and combining those with the node's own attributes.
